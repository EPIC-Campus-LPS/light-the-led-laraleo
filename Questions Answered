What is the purpose of breadboard? The purpose of the breadboard is to be able to connect mujltiple items to one pin and to be able to create circuits.
Does the LED orientation matter (cathode & abode)? Yes it does, the cathodegoes to the ground and the anodee goes to the power. This matters because otherwise your circuit will not work.
Why do you put a resistor in your circuit? You put a resistor in your circuit because otherwise too much power would be going to the LED light and it would explode.
How will a resisitor with greater resistance affect the light? When a resistor has greater resistance it absorbs more of your power, making the LED or other lights dimmer.
